Clean interface focused on WoW clients (3.3.5a), specifically for WoW Epoch servers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR OTHER SERVERS, as ElvUI is a version specific to this app.

My profile features

-> Energy tick for Rogue using WA [it was very difficult to get it to work and is only configured for Rogue, but it will probably work for other classes]

-> Minimalist FPS and MS tracker, Blizzard style

-> Moved from PfUI quests to Questie [it has better quest integration in Epoch]

-> Fixed several bugs and removed all conflicting options

-> All LUA and addon errors have been removed

-> All character voice lines like "out of range" or "I'm out of mana" have been removed, everything is clean

-> Focused on 2K resolution [Full HD, just need to readjust the windows if it bothers you]

-> Minimalist chats [the button to change channels is hidden in the chat, hover over it to view it, and there will be a chat 'Clean,' which only has necessary chats]

-> Optimized for low-end PCs, for PvP and PvE [I might add DBM for raids in the future]

-> Map and minimap display beautiful icons for posts, professions, quests, etc.

How to download?

-> Install the WTF folder [I recommend backing up your original WTF folder] and rename the folders inside it.

-> Install the addons [I recommend backing up your addons]. You can choose which addons you want for this part, but I recommend doing this after starting at least once.

AFTER DOING EVERYTHING CORRECTLY

-> Enter the game, open the ElvUI tab, and go to Profiles. My profile should be there if it doesn't load automatically.
